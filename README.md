# Directions #
1. To use, open powershell and type "$Profile", to get the path of you profile. (Should be something like C:\Users\smithb\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1)
2. Depending on whether the file exists...
    1. If the file exists, open up in file in your least favorite editor. Copy the contents of the https://github.com/jlauerswi/PowershellProfileMac/blob/master/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 and paste it at the end of your file.
    2. If it doesn't exist, then just download https://github.com/jlauerswi/PowershellProfileMac/blob/master/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1, and put it in the directory that your $Profile would be in.

# Future Changes? #
1. It doesn't have a great font.
2. The foreground color of highlighted error messages is orange/red, which doesn't match the foreground color of messages not highlighted.
